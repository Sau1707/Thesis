# Long-term Benefits of Value Investing for Risk Management

The field of finance has seen various investment strategies, each with its unique approach to managing risk and achieving long-term financial success. One such strategy is value investing, emphasizing the concept of a "safety margin," as proposed by Benjamin Graham. This approach has been embraced by successful investors like Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Guy Spier, and renowned investment funds such as the Sequoia Funds. In this Bachelor thesis proposal, we aim to assess the long-term benefits of value investing as a robust risk management strategy.

Value investing is a well-established investment philosophy that identifies undervalued assets in the financial markets. The fundamental principle underlying value investing is to buy assets at a significant discount to their intrinsic value, thus providing a safety margin for investors. This safety margin protects against market volatility and economic downturns, making value investing an attractive approach for risk-averse investors.

-   TCE: subset of shareholders' equity that is not preferred equity and not intangible assets
-   Used to measure company financial strength.
-   indicates how much ownership equity owners of common stock would receive in the event of a company's liquidation
    Formula:
-   TCE = total equity – intangible assets – goodwill – preferred stock
-   tangible assets = total assets - intangible assets - goodwill - preferred stock
-   TCE ratio = TCE / (tangible assets)
-   Leverage ratio = (total assets – intangible assets – goodwill) / TCE

### Margin of Safety

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginofsafety.asp
https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/margin-of-safety-formula/

-   Only buy stocks when their market price is significantly below their intrinsic value.
-   Allow to minimize the downside risk.
-   Utilize both qualitative and quantitative factors: firm management, governance, industry performance, assets and earnings, to determine a security's intrinsic value.
-   Market price is then used as the point of comparison to calculate the margin of safety.
-   "Cornerstones of investing"

$$\text{Margin of Safety} = \frac{\text{Current Sales Level} - \text{Breakeven Point}}{\text{Current Sales Level}} \cdot 100$$

### Value Investing: Bridging Theory and Practice

https://link.springer.com/article/10.7603/s40570-014-0005-3

-   Not only “cheap” stocks, but also “quality” trading at a reasonable price.
-   Assumption: market efficiency, “price equal value” (wrong?)
-   Efficient market hypothesis (EMH): market price incorporate all available information
-   Value investment vs growth investment

-   Graham stock screen: (all hard coded)

    -   EP ratio is double then the AAA bond yield
    -   PE is lower than 40% of the average PE for all the stocks over the last 5 years
    -   Dividend yield > ⅔ of the AAA Corporate Bond Yield
    -   Price < ⅔ of tangible book value
    -   Price < ⅔ of Net Current Asset Value
    -   ecc.

-   First 5 are “cheapnees”, last 5 “quality” of the stocks
-   Still works after 80 years
-   Why keep working? Who is buying the “junk”
    1.  Risk-based explanation:
        -   Longest-standing: value stocks are more risky -> the higher future return is a compensation for the risk
